# Bioinfluencers
The BioInfluencers project emerged under a partnership between the curricular unit of Multimedia Laboratory IV and the Bioliving association, aiming to create a website with the theme of the environment, i.e., take ideals of the association and create something that could be useful to them.

And so BioInfluencers was born, a web platform where great nature influencers are born. In this it is possible to access Bioliving events or others created by users with great influence in the application, in addition, through participation in these it is possible to collect points and win medals or trophies, which, in a way, "grabs" users to this platform. In addition, it is possible to follow other users, publish photographs, participate in various forums, etc. The main objective of this is to make sustainable practices more appealing to everyone.

In order to opt for a graphic line, sketches were drawn on paper, which were later passed to Illustrator and placed in Invision to understand if the website worked as a whole. Afterwards, the website was developed using HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, PHP and MySQL.
